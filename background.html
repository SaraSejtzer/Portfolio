           <p >
            I'm 22 years old, and from a small town called Fredensborg. I'm a creative person as well as a creative thinker. In my spare time, I love to draw especially digitally and of course, hang out with my friends.  
            <br>
            One of the more significant reasons I choose the path as a multimedia designer is the creative thinking involved in the process of making a great product. I also wanted to evolve another hobby of mine, photography. And as a multimedia designer, you get the tools to really take it to the next level.

            <h3 id="edu">Education </h3>
            <p> While at the gymnasium, which was STX (regular gymnasium), I had chosen to study media. This means I had the following courses at the highest level: math, Danish, history, English. I also took media studies at the highest possible level. So I'm familiar with filmmaking and film analysis. I  look forward to using this skill in my way to becoming a multimedia designer, and afterward.
